              <p> Jambo! Thank you for visiting Angaza ~ from the land of the Maasai.

                    Our hope is that you will enjoy shopping our handcrafted items which have all been individually created by
                    selected local artisans from the slums of Kenya.
            
                    So why from the slums? Over the years, we have watched these artisans and tailors though impoverished, create
                    unique pieces and then struggle to sell them at the local markets.
            
                    Angaza is therefore passionate about giving an international platform and fair market for these uniquely created
                    fabric, jewelry, apparel and handcrafted items. Through Angaza, these local artisans will move from an ‘Aid to
                    Trade ‘ideology as they become economically stable.
            
                    The purpose of Angaza is support these talented and highly skilled artisans to become economically stable and
                    break the cycle of poverty.
                    Before it’s launch, Angaza selected (still a continuous process) various artisans with different talents. Our
                    mission is to partner with them to conduct a socially impactful business in a sustainable and fair manner.
            
                    TRACING OUR IMPACT & SUPPLY CHAIN.
            
                    We want to be transparent in every way possible as this is very important for Angaza.
            
                    We also want you to take part in the ethical shopping revolution by inviting you 'behind the scenes' and
                    introducing you to ‘Who created your unique creations’~ we will do that in creative and fun ways by either
                    sending you a hand-written note from the artisan, text message or picture.
            
                    We will also do short stories or an introduction of the various artisans where they get to share how Angaza has
                    been of impact in their lives so far.
            
                    Angaza’s mission is to continue being a socially responsible brand that will continue to support ethical and
                    sustainable sourcing of the materials locally from Kenya and expanding to other African countries.
            
                    Angaza strives to pay the local artisans and tailors a fair wage and have a traceable social impact by working
                    closely with the artisans to ensure that our business Angaza meets fair trade principles
            
                    Our goal for the coming months is understanding what our ethical conscious clients are interested in, growing,
                    learning from those who have begun before us and introducing ourselves in our territory.
            
                    Future goals:
            
                    • Partnering with international designers that will offer exchange platform for knowledge sharing between the
                    international designers and the local artisans so as to continue creating modern creations with a focus on
                    African inspired fabrics and materials.
            
                    • Partnering with the gurus of wax fabrics VLISCO Netherlands who have been creating bolding African fabrics
                    since 1846.
            
                    By showing interest to our creations, you are saying NO to Aid and YES to Trade ideology and transforming lives
                    through supporting our principle of investment instead of Aid.
